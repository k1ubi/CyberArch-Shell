## ⌁ Welcome to Night City, Choom. ::

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29ad19da-6f6f-448d-99d3-b2719943e091" align="right" width="30%" style="margin-left: 20px;">

This is my attempt to recreate Cyberpunk 2077 UI entirely on **Hyprland**, using AGS/Astal to build the HUD similar to the in-game overlay including the widgets, minimaps, and more themed features.

<br clear="right"/>

### About each component

- **Health bars** -> The in-game UI bars meant for Health, Stamina, RAM and Level are copied to provide system monitors:
  - The level badge shows the current active workspace, like [1], [2] and etc.
  -  The Health bars provide average usage in % of CPU load using /proc/stat
  -  The RAM bars...well they provide RAM Memory usage, with ramStat()
  -  the top bar on health for experience, provides the current filesystem storage as `Used/Total` 
  -  The Stamina bar provides the current battery level (if AC, will just stay at 100%)

- **Corner widgets** -> Renders the same UI style of the game UI shortcuts like Radio, Vehicle, Phone, Cyberware item etc
  -  Radio shortcut as Music Player (Toggleable by clicking, or SUPER + SHIFT + O)
  -  System controls for rest of shortcuts like Brightness, Volume, Microphone, Wifi, Bluetooth, Record Screen
  - App tray/Notification center recreated on V's contacts HUD.
    -> the MESSAGES will show the last notifications and their respective apps
    -> the APPS Tray is shows the tray for active apps along with custom tilted context menus

    
- **Minimap** -> Recreates the Minimap from the HUD exactly the same as in-game, showing a random location from `city.json`  
  -  Weather widget below minimap: retrieves the weather forecast for the next 7 days from location at `city.json` using Open Meteo API (Right click to change city location, and double click to see the full forecast)
  -  Network notification: Displays current WiFi/Etherned connected and SSID, or Offline Status along with Upload/Download speed
  -  Market Feed: Shows an interactive widget that displays values and charts for Stocks, Cryptocoins and Trending news. Double-clicking it opens the ''terminal'' that mimicks V computer where you can access websites and buy cars etc, but for market and news.
    
- **Weapon/Item** -> The bottom-right hud that shows weapon/ammo in-game
  -  Shows App Launcher, with a custom icon gathered from the design concepts of Cyberpunk 2077
  -  App Launcher shows a custom launcher that mimicks the Kiroshi Scanner, with audio and animations and the same shape of the 'quickhacks' frames.

- **Pacman hook** -> Displays V's streetcred reputation frame
  - Whenever a new pacman pkg is added, it will show animated frame as "PKG Installed\nVersion XXX" 
  - Whenever AUR packages have upgrades available, it will show update notifications.

- **KILL MODE** -> Starts an animated overlay similar to Kiroshi aswell, click on any app to forcekill it (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+K)
  
- **Screen Recording** -> Starts recording the active screen, and with the same HUD components from in-game when acessing cameras from quickhacks (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+R)

- **Music player** -> Opens/Closes the Media Player, designed pixel-perfect exact as the RADIOPORT in the game. (Toggleable by SUPER+SHIFT+O)
  
- **Quickshell lockscreen** -> ANimated loginscreen with qs.
 
- **Terminal** -> Installs Cool-Retro-Term by Swordfish90 with a red 'Netrunner' profile, in same style of the terminal windows in-game, and the theme default terminal (Rio GPU Terminal) with _custom frames/colors/layouts_ for each theme applied on CyberArch, each theme loads a different .toml theme configuration. Along with an optional fish installation and 'SAMURAI' banner.

## ⌁ Requirements

- **Arch Linux or AUR based distros.** _(Other distros will be available futurely)_
- **Hyprland ≥ 0.56**
- An **AUR helper**: `yay` or `paru` (Always check PKGBUILD btw)
- A running Hyprland session (so theming + first-run setup can apply)

---

## ⌁ Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARCANGEL0/CyberArch-Shell.git 
cd CyberArch-Shell 
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will download any required dependencies, install the theme, quickshell and the necessary packages, along with optional features such as fish, GPU Terminals in theme style, and wallpapers. 

---

## ⌁ Updating

```bash
cd ~/.config/hypr/themes/cyberpunk
./updater.sh
```

The HUD checks for a new release a few seconds after boot and offers the update itself: a
`NEW VERSION VX.Y.Z AVAILABLE` banner slides in with **`SUPER + SHIFT + Q`** to open the changelog and
`J` to dismiss it until the next login. The modal lists what changed and its `UPDATE NOW` button runs the
same `updater.sh` in a terminal so you can watch the whole flow.

`updater.sh` fast-forwards your clone to the latest release tag. Local edits are stashed first (with the
stash ref printed) and untracked files are left alone; if `install.sh` changed in the release it asks
before re-running it, then restarts the HUD.

---

## ⌁ Keybinds

The theme modifier is **`$themeMod = SUPER + SHIFT`**. You can change it on Theme Settings > Keybinds (or change it at the top of `config/keybinds.lua`). 
Open the full cheat-sheet with all keybinds anytime with **`SUPER+SHIFT+H`**.
